    <p>So about myself I'm from Michigan born and raised my name is Ramiz and I am currently attending Oakland University
    for Information Technology. I'm very technology oriented ever since I was younger I loved playing around with new devices
    ,gaming consoles and even PC's. I love to travel ever since covid happened that kind of pushed me away from it for now
    atleast but I hope to travel soon. A few of my hobbies include hiking, playing basketball, watching football games. Currently
    I am a junior in college and am looking for internships in my field. In the future I plan on working in my field of degree which
    I.T it includes many different types of jobs including cybersecurity, desktop support, network engineer, desktop specialist etc
    the list goes on. This field really motivates me because I believe the future is technology so it's just going to keep advancing
    and we as this generation are going to keep evolving it for the future generations. To know more about me check out on my page 2
    and page 3.
